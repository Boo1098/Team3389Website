				<p class="body-text">FRC is the FIRST robotics competition. Each year, teams from across the country build a robot to complete a specific task and then take to competitions. Our team has been doing FRC for the past 7??? years. Last years challenge was called <a class="body-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6UYFKNGHJ8">Recycle Rush</a>. The challenge was to make a robot that can pick up crates and move them into a storing area. Other parts include putting recycling bins on top of the stacks of crates as a multiplier and putting "litter" into the recycling bins for points. Our robot last year, name "This side UP", was made pneumatics lifted up the crates and stacked them simultaneously.</p>
