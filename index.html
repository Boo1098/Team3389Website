						<p class="body-text">Every year we build a robot according to the year`s game. Check out the video from the 2013 competition game called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wa5MGEZNrf0" class="body-link">Ultimate Ascent</a>.  We have only six weeks to design, prototype, build and test a robot to compete in some or all aspects of the annual game.  Coming up with funding to help us with entry fees, parts and travel expenses is never easy as the season can cost anywhere from $13,000 to $30,000 depending on travel expenses and if we qualify for the Championships, so please give our generous sponsors some love by visiting our 
							<a class="body-link" href="sponsors">sponsors page</a> and checking out their services. After our 6 week build period we compete against over 60 other teams at the Chesapeake Regional in Baltimore, MD. We have finished our third year and are beginning our fourth season.
