					<p>This season was the very first year of our <em>FTC</em> team 10382, which branched off of <em>FRC</em> team 3389 in 2015.  It was founded by David Miles. With our block-suck-and-dump robot, WALF, which stands for “We All Love FIRST”, the team placed 3rd at our second competition which qualified us for states.  From the beginning we knew we wanted a bot that could climb.  After much prototyping and brainstorming, it was decided to use treads with “flipper flappers” attached to them, a very <em>“unique”</em> design that ended up working pretty well.  All and all, we placed 12th at regional and ended up in the top 6 percentile of all <em>FTC</em> teams.</p>
